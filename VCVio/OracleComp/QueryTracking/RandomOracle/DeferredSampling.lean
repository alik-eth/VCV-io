# Deferred sampling: tape factorization of answer-irrelevant draws

This module collects the reusable, scheme-independent kernels behind the
*deferred-sampling* technique: rewriting a probabilistic computation whose per-step
draws do not influence the control flow into one where those draws are *front-loaded*
into a single independent "tape", drawn ahead of time and then consumed.

The technique underlies several proofs in this library (Fiat–Shamir with abort, GPV
preimage sampling, collision/birthday bounds). Those proofs each instantiate a bespoke
state machine; what is genuinely generic — and lives here — is:

* **Expectation algebra** (`tsum_probOutput_*`): Tonelli-style rearrangements of an
  expected nonnegative functional through `pure` / `bind` / `Functor.map`, and the
  collapse of a constant-on-support functional. These are the workhorses for pushing a
  fold's expected observable through the monad structure.
* **i.i.d. bind-commutation** (`evalDist_bind_comm`, `evalDist_bind_const_neverFails`,
  `evalDist_bind_congr_left`): the *answer-irrelevant draw commutes past its
  continuation* step at the distribution level. `OracleComp`'s syntactic `bind` is not
  commutative, but its `evalDist` image into `SPMF` is; this is what lets a per-step draw
  be moved to the front tape.
* **The list-multiplicity ε-kernel** (`tsum_count_eq_length`,
  `tsum_probOutput_fresh_mul_count_le`): one fresh draw `w ← oa`, *independent of* a
  value-free list `rl`, contributes expected multiplicity
  `E[rl.count (key w)] ≤ ε · rl.length` whenever each slot is hit with probability `≤ ε`.
  This is the single source of the `ε` in deferred-sampling read bounds.
* **The general factorization statement** (`DeferredTape.Factorizes`): an abstract
  predicate packaging "the read-recording run distributes as a single front draw block
  followed by a tape-consuming run". Scheme-specific factorizations (e.g.
  `FiatShamirWithAbort.evalDist_deferredDrawRead_eq_drawList_tapeDrawRead`) are instances
  of this shape; the predicate names the target so downstream consumers share vocabulary.

The genuinely hard, scheme-specific glue — proving a particular state machine's run *is*
a tape factorization — is not generic and stays with each scheme. What this module
provides is the toolbox that those proofs are built out of.

/-! ## i.i.d. bind-commutation at the distribution level

These lemmas implement the *answer-irrelevant draw commutes past its continuation* step.
`OracleComp`'s `bind` is syntactic and *not* commutative as a free monad, but its
`evalDist` image into `SPMF` is — the two iterated sums over independent draws exchange by
`ENNReal.tsum_comm`. This is the local resampling step that front-loads a draw whose value
the rest of the computation may use but whose *position* is irrelevant. -/

/-! ## The general factorization shape

The hard, scheme-specific content of deferred sampling is proving that a particular
read-recording run *equals* a front-tape factorization. The shape of that target is
generic and named here, so that scheme instances and downstream consumers share a single
vocabulary. -/

/-- **The deferred-tape factorization predicate.** `Factorizes run tape tapeRun` asserts
that running the deferred-draw computation `run : ProbComp γ` is distributionally identical
to first drawing an independent front tape `tape : ProbComp τ` and then running the
tape-consuming variant `tapeRun : τ → ProbComp γ` that reads its per-step draws off the
tape head-first:

`𝒟[run] = 𝒟[tape >>= tapeRun]`.

A scheme establishes this by induction on its adversary computation: at an
*answer-irrelevant* step the front tape commutes past the query (`evalDist_bind_comm`), and
at a *drawing* step the inline draw block is split off the front tape. The
over-provisioned suffix of the tape is discarded by the never-failing prefix lemma
(`evalDist_bind_const_neverFails`). See
`FiatShamirWithAbort.evalDist_deferredDrawRead_eq_drawList_tapeDrawRead` for a worked
instance. -/
def Factorizes {γ τ : Type} (run : ProbComp γ) (tape : ProbComp τ)
    (tapeRun : τ → ProbComp γ) : Prop :=
  𝒟[run] = 𝒟[tape >>= tapeRun]

/-- A factorization may be rewritten through any distribution-level continuation: if
`run` factorizes through `tape`/`tapeRun`, then binding a continuation `k` after `run`
factorizes through `tape` and `tapeRun >=> k` (definitional unfolding plus `evalDist_bind`
associativity). This is the recombination step used when a factorized head feeds a fold. -/

    {tapeRun : τ → ProbComp γ} (h : Factorizes run tape tapeRun) (k : γ → ProbComp δ) :
    Factorizes (run >>= k) tape (fun t => tapeRun t >>= k) := by
  simp only [Factorizes, evalDist_bind] at h ⊢
  rw [h, bind_assoc]

/-! ## The answer-irrelevant step commute (the framework induction step)

The inductive heart of a tape factorization is: at a query whose per-step draw does *not* consult
the tape, the front tape commutes past the step. This is the abstract, state-shape-independent form
of that step — it takes the per-continuation factorization as a hypothesis (the inductive
hypothesis) and concludes the factorization for one more leading answer-irrelevant step. Drawing and
read steps are handled by their own (scheme-specific) splice/commute; this is the
*answer-irrelevant* case, which is fully generic. -/

/-- **Answer-irrelevant step commutes past the front tape.** An answer-irrelevant step
`step : ProbComp (Ans × S)` (a query whose answer-draw does not consult the front tape) composed
with a deferred continuation `defCont` factors as the front tape `tape : ProbComp τ` drawn first,
followed by a tape-threaded continuation:

* `defCont a s' : ProbComp (γ × S)` is the deferred continuation after the step;
* `tapeCont a (s', t) : ProbComp (γ × ρ)` is its tape-consuming variant, threading the tape `t`;
* `proj : γ × ρ → γ × S` discards the spent-tape suffix on output.

Given the per-continuation factorization `hcont` (supplied by the inductive hypothesis), the leading
answer-irrelevant step commutes past the front draw block: the continuation is rewritten by `hcont`
under the step bind (`evalDist_bind_congr_left`), the front tape commutes past the answer-irrelevant
step (`evalDist_bind_comm`), and the inner step bind is re-associated into the mapped tape-step form
(`bind_map_left`/`map_bind`). This is the genuine framework content of a tape factorization's
non-drawing case; see
`FiatShamirWithAbort.evalDist_tapePreserving_step_commute` for the worked Fiat–Shamir instance
(`tape := drawList (ids.commit pk sk) L`, `S := DeferredReadState …`). -/

/-! ## State-relation transfer for expected output functionals

The value-substitution lemmas of deferred sampling (e.g. "the recorded read list of the run is
independent of the rejected-draw content of the start state") are instances of a single generic
fact: an expected output functional through `simulateQ impl` of a `StateT σ ProbComp` handler is
equal at two start states related by `Rel`, provided every query step transfers `Rel` to its
continuation and the functional is `Rel`-invariant. -/

/-- **State-relation transfer for an expected output functional.** Let
`impl : QueryImpl spec (StateT σ ProbComp)` and let `Rel : σ → σ → Prop` be a relation on the
handler state. Suppose:

* every query step transfers `Rel`: for `Rel`-related start states and any `Rel`-invariant
  continuation functional `K`, the per-query expected `K` agrees at the two states (`hstep`);
* the output functional `F : γ → σ → ℝ≥0∞` is `Rel`-invariant (`hF`).

Then the run-level expected output `∑' z, Pr[= z | (simulateQ impl oa).run s] * F z.1 z.2` agrees at
`Rel`-related start states `s₁`, `s₂`. The proof inducts on `oa`: at `pure` the output is the start
state (`hF` applies); at a query bind the step's expected continuation functional is itself
`Rel`-invariant by the inductive hypothesis, so `hstep` closes the step.

This is the generic value-substitution engine; a scheme discharges `hstep` by its per-query run
shapes. See `FiatShamirWithAbort.deferredDrawRead_run_count_dl_invariant` for the worked instance
(the recorded read-list multiplicity is invariant under the start drawn-list and bad-flag). -/
