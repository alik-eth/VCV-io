# Fair PPT security for asynchronous env-open processes

This file lifts the synchronous `Concurrent.Fairness` ticket
machinery to the asynchronous runtime in `AsyncRuntime.lean`, and
packages a fair-PPT computational security definition
`secureAgainstFair` that quantifies over scheduler pairs
satisfying user-specified PPT and fairness predicates.

## Main definitions

* `AsyncRun process envAction` — an infinite execution of the async
  runtime, structured as in `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Run` but
  threading the runtime alphabet `RuntimeEvent Event`.
* `Ticketed Party Δ Event State` — an `EnvOpenProcess` paired with
  a stable ticket map for its underlying process steps. Lifts
  `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Ticketed` to the env-open setting.
* `Ticketed.enabledAt` / `Ticketed.firedAt` — process-side ticket
  predicates evaluated on `AsyncRun`.
* `Ticketed.WeakFairOn` / `StrongFairOn` / `WeakFair` /
  `StrongFair` — process-side fairness predicates lifted from
  `Concurrent.Fairness`.
* `SchedulerPair Party m State Event` — the joint adversary type
  for the async runtime: a process scheduler plus a sibling env
  scheduler.
* `secureAgainstFair mkSem real ideal ε isPPT isFair` — fair-PPT
  computational emulation: every scheduler pair that is both PPT
  and fair distinguishes real from ideal with advantage at most
  `ε`.
* `asympSecureAgainstFair` — security-parameter-indexed,
  negligible variant.

## Design notes

The pair `(isPPT, isFair)` is intentionally orthogonal: PPT does
not imply fair delivery (an efficient adversary may starve a
process), and fair delivery does not imply PPT execution (a fair
scheduler may take unbounded internal computation between
firings).

Three different "fairness" notions in the literature are *not*
collapsed here. *Scheduler fairness* (TLA+ WF/SF, this file) is
the only one captured by `isFair` arguments below. *UC resource
fairness* is a property of the protocol design, and *cryptographic
fair exchange* is a security goal for specific protocols; both
compose orthogonally with `secureAgainstFair`.

Process tickets are the only ticket category lifted in this file.
Env tickets reduce to `Event` itself, but their fairness story is
governed entirely by the env scheduler (i.e. by the `isFair`
predicate the user supplies). Lifting a unified ticket type
carrying both process and env tickets is a deliberate non-goal at
this stage: the two sides have different enable conditions and
different adversary-control attributions and are easier to reason
about separately.

## Universe constraints

The lifted security layer pins move types, env state, env event
alphabets, and the underlying open-process universes to `0`. This
matches the universe constraints already imposed by
`AsyncRuntime.lean` (which threads `ProbComp : Type → Type`
through the runtime), and is required for `(openTheory.{u, 0, 0}
Party).Closed` to be well-formed.

/-! ## Async runs -/

/--
`AsyncRun process envAction` is an infinite execution of the
asynchronous runtime threading the `RuntimeEvent Event` alphabet.

It mirrors `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Run` shape-for-shape, with three
extensions that match `runStepsAsync`:

* `state n` is the *joint* runtime state at step `n`, i.e. the
  residual process state plus the env-action bookkeeping state.
* `event n` records which side fired at step `n`: a `processTick`
  consumes the `procPath`, while an `envTick e` consumes the
  `envSample`.
* `next_state n` enforces the coherence law of one async step: at
  process ticks the proc field advances by the chosen path;
  at env ticks the env state advances to the sampled new state.

This is a freer object than the runtime's randomized executions
(it does not commit to a particular scheduler); fairness
predicates are phrased over `AsyncRun` rather than over the
runtime distribution, exactly as
`Concurrent.ProcessOver.Ticketed.WeakFair` is phrased over
`ProcessOver.Run`.

/-! ## Ticketed env-open processes -/

/--
`Ticketed Party Δ Event State` packages an `EnvOpenProcess` with a
stable ticket map for its underlying open process.

This lifts `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Ticketed` to the env-open
setting. The env channel is *not* assigned tickets here: env
events are scheduled by the environment and are represented in
the runtime trace by their alphabet symbol directly. Process
tickets are the obligations whose firing fairness predicates
constrain.

The bundle pins all relevant universes to `0` to match the
runtime layer in `AsyncRuntime.lean`.

A process ticket is *enabled* at step `n` of an async run when
some path through the current process type tree carries that
ticket.

Equivalent to the synchronous
`Concurrent.ProcessOver.Ticketed.enabledAt` evaluated at the
process state `(run.state n).proc`. The env state is irrelevant
because tickets only label process-step obligations.

    ticketed.ticket (run.state n).proc tr = ticket

/--
A process ticket *fires* at step `n` of an async run when:

1. the runtime fired a `processTick` at step `n`, and
2. the chosen path carries that ticket.

Note the asymmetry with the synchronous `firedAt`: an `envTick`
at step `n` cannot fire a process ticket, even though the
recorded `procPath n` is still well-formed. This matches
the operational reading that env ticks do not advance the
process side.

*Weak fairness* for a single process ticket: continuously enabled
implies fired infinitely often.

Lifts `Concurrent.ProcessOver.Ticketed.WeakFairOn` to async runs,
with the additional `processTick` precondition baked into

fairness by firing nothing but env ticks).

end Ticketed

/-! ## Scheduler pairs -/

/--
`SchedulerPair Party m State Event` bundles the two sibling
samplers driving the async runtime: a process scheduler and an
env scheduler, each indexed by the closed open-theory process
they will run against.

This is the natural "joint adversary" type for the async runtime:
fair-PPT security definitions quantify over scheduler pairs.
-/
structure SchedulerPair
    (Party : Type u) (m : Type → Type) (schedulerSampler : m (ULift Bool))
    (State Event : Type) where
  /-- The process-side sampler, indexed by closed processes. -/
  proc : ∀ p : (openTheory.{u, 0, 0, 0} Party m schedulerSampler).Closed,
    ProcessScheduler m p.Proc State (fun st => (p.step st.proc).tree)
  /-- The env-side sampler, indexed by closed processes. -/
  env : ∀ p : (openTheory.{u, 0, 0, 0} Party m schedulerSampler).Closed,
    EnvScheduler m p.Proc State Event

/-! ## Fair PPT security -/

/--
Fair-PPT computational emulation up to advantage `ε`.

`mkSem` is a *scheduler-parametric* `Semantics` constructor: given
a scheduler pair, it produces a `Semantics` for the open-process
theory `openTheory.{u, 0, 0} Party`. The canonical instantiation is

```
fun s => processSemanticsAsync Party close envAction
  initState init s.proc s.env fuel observe
```

`isPPT` is the user's PPT class on scheduler pairs (typically
specialized to `PolyQueries`-style query bounds plus polynomial
runtime). `isFair` is the user's fairness class (typically
expressed in terms of `Ticketed.WeakFair` / `StrongFair`
evaluated on every run the scheduler pair could induce).

The two predicates are intentionally orthogonal. PPT does *not*
imply fair delivery, and fair delivery does *not* imply PPT
execution. Conflating them would lose the standard
safety/liveness vs. complexity split familiar from TLA+ and from
the PIOA literature.

Asymptotic version of `secureAgainstFair`: a security-parameter
indexed family of `mkSem` constructors and `(real, ideal)` pairs
is *fair-secure* when every PPT, fair adversary has negligible
distinguishing advantage in the security parameter.

The shape mirrors `AsympObservedCompEmulates` from `Computational.lean`:
the adversary type `Adv` is opaque, equipped with PPT and
fairness predicates, plus an `extract` function producing the
scheduler pair and the closing plug at each security parameter.
