# Probability Semantics for Polynomial Free Monads

This module equips an arbitrary polynomial functor with per-operation
probability semantics and interprets its free monad in `PMF`. It also provides
the syntax-only support interpretation in `SetM`. The API is independent of
`OracleSpec`; oracle computations inherit it through their underlying
polynomial functor.

For an oracle spec this is reached explicitly, not by synthesis:
`OracleComp.instEvalDistCompatible` supplies the `IsUniformSpec` premise through
`OracleSpec.IsUniformSpec.toPFunctor`, which is deliberately a definition rather than an
instance so that nothing unifies against the reducible head `spec.toPFunctor`. Keep it that
way — promoting that conversion would make this instance and the oracle-level one both
applicable to the same goal. -/
