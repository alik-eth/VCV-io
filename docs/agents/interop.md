# Interop with Rust verification frontends (hax, aeneas)

`Interop/` is an experimental sibling to `LatticeCrypto/` whose job is to
let VCVio reason about Lean code emitted by Rust verification frontends:

- [hax](https://github.com/cryspen/hax): MIR → Lean/F\*/Coq/EasyCrypt/ProVerif/SSProve via a 35-phase OCaml engine. Lean target produces code in the `Hax.RustM := ExceptT Error Option` monad.
- [aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas): MIR → Lean/Coq/F\* via Charon's LLBC + functional translation. Lean target produces code in an inductive `Aeneas.Std.Result α := ok | fail | div`.

**Current baseline (Lean 4.33):** both integrations are dormant and the
aggregate `Interop` target is excluded from CI. Hax is not yet Lean
4.33-compatible. Aeneas publishes a Lean 4.31 build, so its VCVio bridge must
be ported and revalidated independently before being enabled.

Both backends collapse panic + divergence into the same shape; VCVio adds
oracle access on top. The framework-side target monad is
`Interop.Rust.RustOracleComp`.

## TCB Isolation Contract

This is the headline guarantee: **adding `Interop/` does not increase the
trusted computing base (TCB) of core VCVio**.

Rust verification frontends drag in a sizeable trusted layer (extraction
engine, Charon's LLBC frontend, the backend's own runtime axioms), and we
never want a routine `lake build` of the core framework to inherit that.
The contract is therefore enforced at three levels:

1. **Lake**: `Interop` is its own `lean_lib` in `lakefile.lean`, sibling
   to `LatticeCrypto`/`Examples`. Cross-library imports are physical.
2. **CI**: `scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` greps for forbidden
   imports. `.github/workflows/interop-isolation.yml` runs it on every PR
   and on pushes to `main`. The script also runs without a Lean toolchain,
   so it is fast and never blocks on Mathlib cache or build flakiness.
3. **Reverse direction**: `Interop/**` may import from `VCVio/**`,
   `ToMathlib/**`, `Hax.…`, and `Aeneas.…`, but **not** from
   `LatticeCrypto/**`, `Examples/**`, `LatticeCryptoTest/**`, `Extern/**`,
   `VCVioWidgets/**`, or `VCVioTest/**`.
   Those libraries are themselves clients of VCVio, so Interop depending on
   them would create circular layering and pull user-facing libraries into the
   Interop TCB.

The isolation script accepts no flags besides `--help`; just run
`bash scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` from the repo root.

If you need to share infrastructure between Interop and another library,
move the shared piece into `VCVio/` first.

```

`Rust/Common.lean` is **self-contained**: it builds without hax or aeneas
loaded. It mirrors the shared `Error` enum locally and defines

```lean
abbrev RustOracleComp (spec : OracleSpec ι) (α : Type) :=
  ExceptT Error (OptionT (OracleComp spec)) α
```

so that lifts from hax's `RustM = ExceptT Error Option` are the obvious
"wrap the `Option` in `pure`" mapping, and lifts from aeneas's `Result`
are case analysis. Both target `RustOracleComp spec`, giving us a single
oracle-aware Rust target monad for both backends.

## Git-pinned Backend Requires

`lakefile.lean` carries explicit git pins for both backends. Current
state:

```lean
-- Disabled: upstream Hax does not build under Lean 4.33.
-- require Hax from git
--   "https://github.com/cryspen/hax" @
--   "492a34e3" / "hax-lib/proof-libs/lean"

-- Disabled pending a Lean 4.33 port; upstream pin uses Lean 4.31.
-- require aeneas from git
--   "https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas" @
--   "15b968482b0dcd7aae45020b6d1bca39b5024af5" / "backends/lean"
```

Git-pin by default so reproducible builds are guaranteed; bumping a pin
is a deliberate one-line change reviewed alongside any TCB delta. The
isolation check runs regardless of whether the requires are active, so
the contract holds even mid-experiment.

**Require-order rule.** `require Hax` (and any future backend require) must
appear *before* `require "leanprover-community" / "mathlib"`. The current
`loom2` require also sits before Mathlib because it is part of the same
toolchain-sensitive dependency block. Hax transitively pins `Qq` at
`v4.29.0-rc1`, Mathlib pins it at the final release. Lake's conflict resolver
takes the *last* `require` of each package, so Mathlib must be last. Wrong
order produces `mathlib: failed to fetch cache` on `lake update`, with a clear
warning from Lake.

## Toolchain Status (empirical, as of 2026-04-17)

- **VCVio**: `leanprover/lean4:v4.29.0` + Mathlib `v4.29.0`.
- **hax `492a34e3`** (upstream: `v4.29.0-rc1`): `lake build Hax`
  succeeds in 91 jobs. Two harmless `@[reducible]` warnings in
  `Hax/rust_primitives/USize64.lean`; nothing blocks us.
- **aeneas `ba600392`** (upstream: `v4.28.0-rc1`): `lake update` resolves
  cleanly under our root Mathlib/Lean pins, but `lake build Aeneas`
  reaches only 1625/1662 jobs before **three** source-level regressions
  propagate:
  - `Aeneas/Std/Primitives.lean:168:44` — kernel type mismatch in
    `CCPO (Result α) := inferInstanceAs (CCPO (FlatOrder .div))`. This is
    inside the one file we need.
  - `Aeneas/Tactic/Simproc/ReduceZMod/ReduceZMod.lean:83:10` — Mathlib
    removed / renamed `Monoid.toNatPow` in v4.29.
  - `Aeneas/Tactic/Simp/RingEqNF/Tests.lean:113:11` — `ring_nf`
    normalization differs; tests-only.

  Because regression #1 is the file that defines `Result α`, there is no
  partial-import workaround. Unblock by waiting for upstream to ship a
  v4.29 build, or by maintaining a short patch series on a fork.

Bump the hax pin (or un-comment aeneas once fixed) by editing the
`require` line(s) in `lakefile.lean` and running `lake update Hax`
(resp. `aeneas`).

## Bridge Design (Reference)

With the hax require enabled, `Interop/Hax/Bridge.lean` begins:

```lean
import Hax.rust_primitives.RustM
import Interop.Rust.Common

namespace Interop.Hax

instance {ι : Type} {spec : OracleSpec ι} :
    MonadLift Hax.RustM (Interop.Rust.RustOracleComp spec) where
  monadLift x := ⟨⟨pure x.run⟩⟩
```

Plus boundary lemmas on `Std.Do.Triple` showing that the lift preserves
hax's WP shape (`.except Error (.except PUnit .pure)`) inside the
equivalent VCVio shape, since `ExceptT Error (OptionT _)` composes to
exactly that PostShape.

For aeneas, `Interop/Aeneas/Bridge.lean` will pattern-match on `Result`:

```lean
def errorOfAeneas : Aeneas.Std.Error → Interop.Rust.Error := ...

def ofResult {ι : Type} {spec : OracleSpec ι} {α : Type}
    (r : Aeneas.Std.Result α) : Interop.Rust.RustOracleComp spec α :=
  match r with
  | .ok v   => pure v
  | .fail e => Interop.Rust.RustOracleComp.fail (errorOfAeneas e)
  | .div    => Interop.Rust.RustOracleComp.div
```

with `errorOfAeneas` (and `errorOfHax`) being constructor-by-constructor
maps from the upstream isomorphic enum.

## Risks and Open Questions

- **Duplicate `Error` enums**. `Hax.Error` and `Aeneas.Std.Error` are
  structurally identical but distinct types. We mirror as
  `Interop.Rust.Error` and convert at the boundary to avoid littering
  proofs with three-way coercions.
- **Hax `Std.Do` `@[spec]` `DiscrTree`**. Both hax and VCVio register
  `@[spec]` lemmas with `mvcgen`. Quarantine hax tactic imports to
  `Interop/Hax/**` so the global key set is loaded only when an Interop
  module asks for it.
- **Notation collisions**. The `⦃ ⦄ ⦃ ⦄` Hoare-triple notation is
  shared. Practice has been fine because both notations resolve through
  `Std.Do.Triple`, but be alert to `local notation` overrides in hax
  modules.
- **Loop combinators**. Hax's `RustM` has `Loop.MonoLoopCombinator`
  instances for `partial_fixpoint`. `RustOracleComp` doesn't yet, and
  may not need to if the lift comes after partial-fixpoint resolution
  on the hax side.
- **Aeneas tactic infrastructure** (`@[step]`, `step!`) cannot be reused
  on the VCVio side. Drive proofs with VCVio's `mvcgen` after lifting.
- **Verification Facade / Theatre concerns**. Both Charon and the hax
  engine are part of the TCB once a backend is enabled. Document any
  trusted assumption in `Interop/{Hax,Aeneas}/README.md`. See
  `vcvio-hax-aeneas-integration-council.md` in `~/Documents/Notes/` for
  the long-form risk analysis.

## Workflow

1. **Modify Interop only** for first-pass experiments. The CI isolation
   check will catch accidental cross-imports, but reviewing `git diff`
   for `VCVio/` paths catches them earlier.
2. **Run `bash scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` locally** before
   pushing. It is fast and toolchain-free.
3. **`./scripts/update-lib.sh`** after adding new Lean files under
   `Interop/`; the umbrella `Interop.lean` regenerates.
4. **Bump pins explicitly**: edit the `require` line, run `lake update
   <Pkg>`, commit `lake-manifest.json` together with the pin change.
5. **Document any TCB delta** in `Interop/{Hax,Aeneas}/README.md` and
   cross-reference from PR descriptions.
