# Sketch: aspect-indexed observation kernels for sealed-sender messaging

A Signal-flavored single-step protocol used to exercise
`Multiparty.Observation` and the `ObservationProfile` algebra.

Three real parties (Sender, Server, Recipient) plus a passive Network observer
exchange one structured packet. Different parties — and different
**corruptions** of those parties — observe **different projections** of the
same underlying packet. The honest Server is "honest-but-curious" and sees
routing + ciphertext but not the MAC tag; the passive Network observer sees
only the envelope, the ciphertext length, and the timestamp; corruption
modes upgrade or downgrade specific parties' observation kernels.

The point of this sketch is not to model a complete protocol. It is to
demonstrate that:

* per-party observation kernels are naturally **`Observation`-valued** functions
  of a corruption mode, not `ViewMode`-valued ones;
* refinement (`≤` on `Observation` via the `Preorder` instance) is the natural
  "this corruption reveals no more than that one" relation;
* coalition observations (`⊔` on `Observation` via the `Max` instance) are the
  natural Σ-product join in the information lattice;
* the lifting back into the `ViewProfile` / `Profile.Strategy` pipeline goes
  through `ObservationProfile.toViewProfile`, with one bridge step per node.

Sealed-sender (the Server's view of `envFrom` is *removed*) and a MAC-aware
network adversary (the Network's view of `macTag` and `tagLen` is *added*)
are concrete corruption directions in this sketch.

Throughout, we use Mathlib's order notation (`⊤`, `⊥`, `≤`, `⊔`) rather than
the named `Observation.top` / `Observation.bot` / `Observation.Refines` /
`Observation.combine` operations. Both APIs are equivalent definitionally;
the notation buys readability and lets profile-level facts come through
`Pi`-instance lifting.

/-- An idealized end-to-end packet for one send. -/
structure Packet where

  /-- Length of the ciphertext. -/

passive Network observer. -/

  | Sender
  | Server
  | Recipient
  | Net
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- A small space of corruption modes. -/
inductive Mode
  | clean
  | serverFull         -- Server fully corrupted: sees the entire packet
  | serverSealed       -- Sealed-sender: Server's `envFrom` is hidden

  deriving DecidableEq

/-- The honest Server's observation: routing + ciphertext + timestamp, no MAC. -/
structure ServerView where
  envFrom : Nat
  envTo : Nat

/-- The honest passive Network observer: envelope + ciphertext length + timestamp. -/
structure NetView where

/-- Sealed-sender's view of the Server: as `ServerView` but with `envFrom`
stripped. -/

MAC tag and its length. -/

Each fact is a single-line `⟨factor_map, fun _ => rfl⟩` proof, illustrating
how refinement reduces to giving a Σ-factorization between observation
types. -/

/-! ## Per-mode observation profiles -/

open Profile

/-- The corruption-mode-indexed observation: for each mode and party, the
observation kernel of that party in that mode.

* In every mode, `Sender` and `Recipient` see the full packet (their
  operational shapes — `.pick` and `.observe` respectively — would be
  recovered from a separate operational decoration; here we only record their
  *observation kernel*, which is the top of the information lattice `⊤`).
* `Server`'s kernel varies with the mode: honest, sealed, or fully corrupted.
* `Net`'s kernel varies between honest and MAC-aware. -/
def observationOf : Mode → Party → Observation Packet
  | _,                .Sender    => ⊤
  | _,                .Recipient => ⊤
  | .clean,           .Server    => Observations.serverHonest
  | .serverSealed,    .Server    => Observations.serverSealed

  | .serverFull,      .Net       => Observations.netHonest
  | .netMacAware,     .Net       => Observations.netMacAware

/-- The observation profile attached to one node in a given corruption mode.

This is the *kernel-form* analogue of a `ViewProfile` per node. Plugging it
into `Profile.Strategy` requires `ObservationProfile.toViewProfile` to bridge
to the existing endpoint pipeline. -/
def observationProfile (m : Mode) : ObservationProfile Party Packet :=
  fun p => observationOf m p

/-- The induced view profile (each party's observation kernel becomes the
universal `.react` `ViewMode`). -/
def viewProfile (m : Mode) : ViewProfile Party Packet :=
  ObservationProfile.toViewProfile (observationProfile m)

/-! ## Refinement facts on profiles

These illustrate the payoff of working at the kernel level: monotonicity in
the corruption order is proved pointwise by the per-observation refinement
facts above, with no four-case `ViewMode` matching. The pointwise `≤` on
profiles comes from `Pi.preorder` and the per-party `Preorder (Observation
Packet)` instance — no manual `Refines` definition is needed. -/

/-- Sealed-sender mode is no more revealing than the clean mode (only `Server`
differs, and the sealed-sender Server kernel refines the honest Server
kernel). -/

Server kernel). -/

/-! ## Coalition example

The `Server`-`Net` coalition's observation in the clean mode is the Σ-product
of `serverHonest` and `netHonest`. Both factors refine into it, automatically. -/

the two honest kernels (the **join** in the information lattice). -/
