# Regression checks for drawing without replacement

`ProbComp.expectedLength_drawUntil` equates a sampling loop with the arithmetic recursion
`NegHypergeom.expectedDraws`, so a green build establishes the two agree but not that either says
anything. The checks below pin down concrete values on both sides, and pin down the boundary that
motivates the whole generalization.

**Exhaustion is real.** `NegHypergeom.expectedDraws_eq` needs `r ≤ G`; below that the loop cannot
collect `r` successes and instead drains the pool, and the closed form is then strictly wrong
(`expectedDraws_ne_closedForm_of_exhaustion`). `NegHypergeom.expectedDraws_le` survives, which is
why the coordinate-wise extractor can use one bound for both cases.
