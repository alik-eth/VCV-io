# ML-DSA EUF-NMA Security: the MLWE key-swap hop (Lemma 7, Step 1)

This file builds the reduction infrastructure for the ML-DSA EUF-NMA security theorem
`MLDSA.nma_security` (issue #227, the real Dilithium Lemma 7), covering the **MLWE key-swap hop**
and the **SelfTargetMSIS extractor**:

1. **MLWE key-swap (`nma_keyswap_hop`).** Replace the honest key generation, where the public key
   vector is `t = Â · s₁ + s₂`, with a variant `keygen1` that samples `t` uniformly. The gap
   between the two EUF-NMA games equals the decisional MLWE advantage of the (seed-based)
   distinguisher `B = distinguisherB`. The `(Hadv)` and uniform-branch `(H1)` parts are pure
   runtime-plumbing rewrites; the real-branch `(H0)` is discharged from the honest-sampling field
   `Primitives.Laws.expandS_honest_sampling` (the ROM idealization of `ExpandSeed`/`ExpandS`).
2. **SelfTargetMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** Once `t` is uniform the key
   carries no secret, so a forgery is a short vector satisfying the SelfTargetMSIS relation; the
   extractor `extractorC` reads `(z, c̃)` out of the forged signature. This is fully proven: the
   shared random-oracle simulation lines up the NMA `verify` query with the extractor's RO read-back
   (`stmsis_tail_le`), and an accepted forgery is a valid SelfTargetMSIS solution by commitment
   recoverability.

The `H₁` reprogramming step of the paper folds into the random-oracle modeling and is not separated
out here. `MLDSA.nma_security` assembles the two steps under the bridge hypotheses negotiated in its
statement (`hGen`, `hStmsis`, `hMlweBridge`).

## What is defined here

The honest ML-DSA key distribution embeds an MLWE instance: sample a public seed `ρ`, set the
public matrix `Â = ExpandA(ρ)`, sample short secrets `(s₁, s₂)`, and publish the `Power2Round`
high half of `t = Â · s₁ + s₂`. The uniform-`t` variant replaces `Â · s₁ + s₂` by a uniform
sample. We package both as `ProbComp` key generators, lift each to an EUF-NMA game over an
arbitrary forging adversary `main`, and exhibit the MLWE distinguisher `B` that interpolates
between them: `B (Â, t)` reconstructs the public key from `(ρ, t)` and runs the adversary.

## Modeling note (seeds, not matrices)

The verifier recomputes `Â = ExpandA(pk.ρ)` from the seed stored in the public key, so the MLWE
challenge matrix `Â` must be presented to the adversary *through* a seed `ρ`. Rather than carrying
an embedding witness `ExpandA(ρ) = Â` (which need not exist, since `ExpandA` is not surjective), we
**re-seed-base** the MLWE problem: the public challenge of `mldsaMLWE` is the *seed* `ρ` itself, and
the matrix is *defined* as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)` wherever it is used, so that
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ)·s₁`.
This is the standard ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the
distinguisher `B` total: it consumes `(ρ, t)` and forms `pk = (ρ, Power2Round(t).1)` directly with
no embedding. The `MlweEmbedding` record is therefore gone.

/-- The concrete MLWE problem embedded by ML-DSA key generation, **seed-based**: the public
challenge is the public matrix seed `ρ = (ExpandSeed(seed)).1` for a uniform `seed`, the secret is
`s₁`, and the output is `t`. The matrix is recovered on demand as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)`, so
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ) · s₁`; the secret and error/uniform distributions are uniform.

Sampling `ρ` through `ExpandSeed` (rather than uniformly) makes the `ρ` marginal line up *exactly*
with `keygen0` / `keygen1`, so the uniform-branch identity `(H1)` against `keygen1` is a clean
monad-rewriting fact (no distributional assumption: `keygen1` discards the secret, and its `ρ` is
this same `(ExpandSeed seed).1`). What it does **not** reconcile is the *joint* law of `(ρ, s₁, s₂)`
in `keygen0`, where `(s₁, s₂) = ExpandS((ExpandSeed seed).2)` are derived from the *same* seed as
`ρ`, whereas the MLWE problem samples `s₁`/error independently of `ρ`; that joint independence is
the residual honest-sampling gap `(H0)` recorded below and folded into the ROM by the paper.

The matrix never appears as a free challenge: phrasing the MLWE instance over seeds is exactly the
ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the distinguisher `B` total
(no `ExpandA`-surjectivity assumption). The `nma_security` statement quantifies over an *abstract*
`mlwe` problem; relating that abstract problem to this concrete seed-based one is a deferred
statement-level obligation. -/

directly from the seed, runs the NMA forging strategy `main` on `pk`, simulates the random oracle
to verify the returned forgery, and outputs the validity bit as its decision.

When `(ρ, t)` is real, `B` reproduces `nmaGame … keygen0`; when `t` is uniform, it reproduces
`nmaGame … keygen1`. Thus `B`'s distinguishing advantage is exactly the NMA-game gap (the content
of `nma_keyswap_hop`). The seed-based phrasing means `B` needs no matrix-to-seed embedding. -/

/-- **The MLWE key-swap hop (Lemma 7, Step 1).** For every NMA forging strategy `main`, the gap
between the real-`t` and uniform-`t` EUF-NMA games is bounded by (in fact equal to) the decisional
MLWE advantage of the seed-based distinguisher `B`.

The proof factors through three facts:
- **(Hadv)** the MLWE advantage equals `(game0 B).boolDistAdvantage (game1 B)`
  (`advantage_eq_game_boolDistAdvantage`, fully proven and generic);
- **(H1)** `nmaGame … keygen1` and `game1 (mldsaMLWE) B` have equal `Pr[= true]`
  (proven below: both are the uniform-`t` game, and the `ρ` marginals coincide because
  `mldsaMLWE` samples `ρ` through the *same* `ExpandSeed` that `keygen1` uses, and `keygen1`'s
  secret is discarded);
- **(H0)** `nmaGame … keygen0` and `game0 (mldsaMLWE) B` have equal `Pr[= true]` — discharged from
  the honest-sampling field `h_laws.expandS_honest_sampling` (the ROM idealization of
  `ExpandSeed`/`ExpandS`); see the inline comment for exactly what it needs.

This is the first of the three steps of `nma_security`; steps 2 and 3 (the `H₁` reprogramming and
the SelfTargetMSIS extraction) are handled elsewhere. The bound is stated on `toReal` because the
NMA advantages are `ℝ≥0∞` while MLWE advantage is `ℝ`. -/

`verify` is, via the random oracle answer `c̃ = H(msg, w')`, a SelfTargetMSIS solution: the matrix
`Â = ExpandA(ρ)` is the challenge, the public key `pk` is the target, the hash input is `(msg, w')`,
and the response is `(z, h)`. Validity recomputes the commitment from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` via
`UseHint ∘ computeWApprox` (commitment recoverability) and runs the identification-scheme verifier;
this is precisely the equation `verify` checks, so an accepted forgery maps to a valid STMSIS
solution.

The `sampleParams` draws the same seed-based key as `keygen1`/`mldsaMLWE`: it samples `ρ` through
`ExpandSeed`, a uniform `t`, and publishes `(ExpandA(ρ), pk)` with `pk = ⟨ρ, Power2Round(t).1⟩`. -/

/-- **The SelfTargetMSIS extractor `C` (Lemma 7, Step 3).**

`C` runs the NMA forger `main` on the public key `pk` (the STMSIS target). The forger interacts with
the random oracle `H : (M × Commitment) →ₒ CommitHashBytes`. On a forgery `(msg, some (w', (z, h)))`
`C` outputs the STMSIS preimage `(msg, w')` together with the response `(z, h)`. An aborting forgery
`(msg, none)` is mapped to a dummy preimage with a zeroed response, which the STMSIS RO-consistency
check rejects. The matrix in `params.1` is ignored by `C` (it equals `ExpandA(params.2.ρ)`).

The STMSIS experiment then looks up `c̃ = H(msg, w')` in the oracle cache and checks
`mldsaSTMSIS.isValid Â pk c̃ (z, h)`, which recomputes `w'` from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` and runs the
identification verifier — exactly what the NMA `verify` does after querying `H(msg, w')`. -/

      return ((msg, default), default)

/-- **Per-key STMSIS read-back comparison.** For a fixed public key `pk`, the NMA forge-and-verify
tail (run through `simulateToProbComp`) accepts no more often than the SelfTargetMSIS experiment
tail of `extractorC` at the matching parameters `(ExpandA(ρ), pk)`.

Both tails first simulate `main pk` against the same random oracle from the empty cache; the proof
compares them after that shared prefix (`probOutput_bind_mono`). On an aborting forgery the NMA tail
is deterministically `false`. On a forgery `some (w', (z, h))` both branches issue the *same*
`H(msg, w')` query on the *same* cache, so the random answer `c̃` and the resulting cache coincide;
the STMSIS experiment then reads `c̃` back and `mldsaSTMSIS.isValid` recovers `w'` as exactly the
`useHintVec …` value that `verify` checks against, so an accepted NMA forgery is a valid STMSIS
solution. -/

/-- **NMA Security (Lemma 7, CRYPTO 2023).**

For every EUF-NMA adversary `A` against the ML-DSA scheme (instantiated via `FiatShamirWithAbort`
over the real ML-DSA key generation `keygen0`), there exist an MLWE adversary `B` and a
SelfTargetMSIS adversary `C` such that

  `Adv^{EUF-NMA}(A) ≤ Adv^{MLWE}(B) + Adv^{SelfTargetMSIS}(C)`.

The reductions are the concrete ones built in this file: the MLWE key-swap distinguisher
`distinguisherB` (whose advantage against the seed-based `mldsaMLWE` problem dominates the
real-vs-uniform key gap, `nma_keyswap_hop`) and the SelfTargetMSIS extractor `extractorC` (which
turns a uniform-`t` forgery into a short self-target solution, `nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).

Because the verifier recomputes `Â = ExpandA(pk.ρ)` from the published seed, the concrete MLWE
instance is phrased over seeds (`mldsaMLWE`, with `Sample = Bytes 32`), whose `Sample` type differs
from an abstract matrix-based `mlwe`. The hypothesis `hMlweBridge` therefore supplies, for every
forging strategy, an abstract MLWE adversary at least as good as `distinguisherB`. The
SelfTargetMSIS side has matching types, so `hStmsis` is a plain equality `stmsis = mldsaSTMSIS p
prims M`, and
`hGen : hr.gen = keygen0 p prims` pins the Fiat-Shamir key generation to the real ML-DSA keygen.

This is the EUF-NMA half (Lemma 7) of the ML-DSA security proof; the CMA-to-NMA statistical step
(`euf_cma_security_of_nma`) composes on top of it. -/

/-- **EUF-CMA security of ML-DSA (Theorem 4, CRYPTO 2023), wired end to end.**

This is the sound CMA-to-NMA-to-hardness composition. It relocates here (rather than to
`LatticeCrypto.MLDSA.Security`) to avoid the circular import: `nma_security` lives in this
file, which already imports `LatticeCrypto.MLDSA.Security`.

For any EUF-CMA adversary `adv` against the Fiat-Shamir-with-aborts ML-DSA signature, the
advantage is bounded by the MLWE advantage, the SelfTargetMSIS advantage, and the
statistical CMA-to-NMA loss `FiatShamirWithAbort.cmaToNmaLoss`. The proof composes three
pieces:

1. `FiatShamirWithAbort.euf_cma_to_nma`: `adv.advantage ≤ Pr[managedRoNmaExp simulatedNmaAdv]
   + cmaToNmaLoss`, under the good-key/commitment-guessing/abort/query hypotheses;
2. `FiatShamirWithAbort.managedRoNmaExp_simulatedNmaAdv_eq_eufNmaExp` (Option B): the managed-RO
   NMA success probability equals the plain EUF-NMA advantage of `simulatedEufNmaAdv`, the
   cache-forgetting reduction — this is the soundness fix that makes the bridge legitimate;
3. `nma_security` (Lemma 7) applied to `simulatedEufNmaAdv`: `≤ MLWE + SelfTargetMSIS`.

The loss parameters carry the nonnegativity and good-key hypotheses that the abstract
reduction needs; the `nma_security` bridge hypotheses (`hGen`, `hStmsis`, `hMlweBridge`) pin
the abstract hardness problems to the concrete ML-DSA ones. -/

/-- **EUF-CMA security of ML-DSA with the HVZK hypotheses discharged.**

A corollary of `euf_cma_security_of_nma` that instantiates the abstract HVZK simulator with the
proven ML-DSA simulator `hvzkSimulatorReal` and discharges the `hhvzk` obligation via
`idsWithAbort_hvzk_real`. The zero-knowledge slack `ζ_zk` is therefore exposed as its concrete
value `hvzkBoundReal p prims` — the supremum over honestly generated key pairs of the
prover's extra-rejection mass — rather than being a free parameter.

Compared with `euf_cma_security_of_nma`, this statement drops the four HVZK hypotheses
(`sim`, `ζ_zk`, `hζ`, `hhvzk`): the simulator and its quantitative bound are now supplied by the
already-proven `idsWithAbort_hvzk_real`. The remaining hypotheses are unchanged. The abort-rate
side conditions `hAbort`/`hAbortSim` are retained: they bound a different quantity (the abort
probability of, respectively, the honest execution and the simulator) and are not implied by the
HVZK bound without strengthening `p_abort` to `p_abort + ζ_zk`.

The `hvzkBoundReal p prims` slack is a genuine finite real bound (a probability mass projected
through `ENNReal.toReal`, nonnegative by `ENNReal.toReal_nonneg`), not a vacuous `⊤` placeholder. -/

/-! ## Asymptotic (negligible) EUF-CMA headline

The non-degenerate asymptotic statement. The scheme is indexed by a security parameter `n`
through a *family* `(p n, prims n)` of ML-DSA parameter/primitive instances, so that the
commitment guessing probability `ε n`, the key-regularity failure `δ n`, and the HVZK slack
`hvzkBoundReal (p n) (prims n)` all shrink (negligibly) as `n → ∞` while the signing / hashing
query budgets `qS n`, `qH n` grow only polynomially in `n`. Under negligible MLWE and
SelfTargetMSIS advantage families this makes the EUF-CMA advantage family negligible.

The earlier fixed-scheme wrapper was degenerate: with a *constant* `ε > 0` the loss term
`2·qS·(qH+1)·ε/(1−p)` is only negligible when the query budgets vanish. Here the slacks are
themselves negligible families, so each loss term is `poly(n) · negligible(n)`, which is negligible
by `negligible_polynomial_mul`. -/

/-- **Asymptotic (negligible) EUF-CMA security of ML-DSA.**

The security-parameter-indexed, non-degenerate headline. The ML-DSA scheme is given as a *family*
`(p n, prims n)` over the security parameter `n`, with all carrier instances supplied per `n`. The
hypotheses are the `n`-indexed lifts of those of `euf_cma_security_of_nma_hvzk`, plus:

* polynomial query bounds `qS n ≤ pS.eval n`, `qH n ≤ pH.eval n` (poly-time adversaries);
* negligible commitment-guessing slack `ε`, key-regularity slack `δ`, and HVZK slack
  `hvzkBoundReal (p n) (prims n)` (the commitment / response spaces grow with `n`);
* negligible MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS advantage families `mlweAdv`, `stmsisAdv` dominating every
  reduction adversary (the hardness assumptions, carried as `n`-indexed families per the standard
  ROM model).

The conclusion is that the EUF-CMA advantage family of `adv` is negligible. The proof instantiates
the per-`n` bound `euf_cma_security_of_nma_hvzk`, dominates the two existential reductions by their
negligible families, and bounds the statistical loss family with `cmaToNmaLoss_negligible`: with
polynomially-bounded queries and negligible slacks each loss term is `poly(n) · negligible(n)`.

This is non-vacuous in the real regime: the hypotheses are jointly satisfiable with query budgets
growing polynomially (e.g. `qS n = qH n = n`) and slacks vanishing super-polynomially (e.g.
`ε n = δ n = (1 / 2) ^ n`), which is exactly the standard asymptotic ML-DSA setting — not the
degenerate vanishing-query regime. -/

The quantitative hypotheses of `euf_cma_security_asymptotic_real` — *polynomially-bounded* query
budgets together with *negligible* statistical slacks (commitment guessing `ε`, HVZK `ζ_zk`, key
regularity `δ`) and negligible hardness advantage families — are jointly satisfiable with query
budgets that genuinely **grow** with the security parameter. Concretely, taking
`qS n = qH n = n` (bounded by `Polynomial.X`, i.e. *not* vanishing), all slacks and advantage
families equal to `(1 / 2) ^ n`, and `p_abort = 1 / 2`, the resulting `cmaToNmaLoss` family,
together with the two hardness families, is negligible — so the dominating sum in the headline's
internal bound is negligible.

This rules out the degenerate reading of the headline (where polynomial queries against a *fixed*
positive `ε` would force the budgets to vanish): here the budgets grow polynomially while the loss
still decays, which is exactly the standard asymptotic ML-DSA setting. -/

/-! ## Status

**Re-seed-base done.** `MlweEmbedding` is gone: `mldsaMLWE` is now phrased over the public *seed*
`ρ` (sampled through `ExpandSeed`), with the matrix defined on demand as `ExpandA(ρ)`;
`distinguisherB` consumes `(ρ, t)` directly and is total. The whole `nma_security` headline is
proven and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`), assembled from:

1. **`(Hadv)`/`(H1)`/`(H0)` MLWE key-swap (`nma_keyswap_hop`).** `(Hadv)` and the uniform branch
   `(H1)` are pure runtime-plumbing rewrites (`advantage_eq_game_boolDistAdvantage`,
   `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind`). The real branch `(H0)` reduces, after the plumbing, to the pure
   key-distribution identity
   `𝒟[seed ← $ᵗ; run B-tail on pk(seed, ExpandA(ρ)·(ExpandS ρ').1 + (ExpandS ρ').2)] =
    𝒟[seed ← $ᵗ; s₁ ← $ᵗ; s₂ ← $ᵗ; run B-tail on pk(seed, ExpandA(ρ)·s₁ + s₂)]`
   (with `ρ = (ExpandSeed seed).1`, `ρ' = (ExpandSeed seed).2`), which is discharged by the
   honest-sampling field `Primitives.Laws.expandS_honest_sampling` carried by `h_laws`: the ROM
   idealization of `ExpandSeed`/`ExpandS` as independent uniform XOFs. (This idealization is a
   modeling assumption, not derivable from the deterministic `prims`; strengthening or instantiating
   it on a concrete `prims` is the one remaining modeling decision.)

2. **STMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** Both `Pr[= true]`s reduce, through the
   shared `withStateOracle` semantics, to: sample the uniform-`t` key, run the forger against the
   RO, and on `some (w', (z,h))` read `c̃ = H(msg, w')` from the cache and accept iff
   `ids.verify pk w' c̃ (z,h)`. After `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` both sides bind over the same
   `keygen1` prefix, so `probOutput_bind_mono` reduces to the per-key lemma `stmsis_tail_le`, which
   decomposes both tails over the shared `main pk` simulation, gives weight `0` to the aborting
   branch, and on a non-aborting forgery couples the single `H(msg, w')` query — the cached answer
   is read back (`QueryImpl.withCaching_run_some`/`_none`, `QueryCache.cacheQuery_self`) and
   `verify = true → isValid = true` (the middle `decide (X = X)` conjunct) closes the per-answer
   inequality.

3. **Bridge to the abstract `mlwe`/`stmsis`/`hr` of `nma_security`.** `nma_security` quantifies over
   an *abstract* `mlwe`, an *abstract* `stmsis`, and an *abstract* `hr` whose `gen` need not be
   ML-DSA keygen, while the reductions here are against the *concrete* `mldsaMLWE` / `mldsaSTMSIS`
   and `keygen0/1`. The bridge hypotheses are part of the statement: `hGen : hr.gen = keygen0 p
   prims`, `hStmsis : stmsis = mldsaSTMSIS p prims M`, and `hMlweBridge` supplying an abstract MLWE
   adversary at least as good as `distinguisherB`. The proof combines (1) and (2) through the
   triangle bound `probOutput_true_le_add_ofReal_boolDistAdvantage`.
