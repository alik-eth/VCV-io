# VCVio — AI Agent Guide

Machine-checked cryptographic proofs in Lean, built on Mathlib.

## Fast Start

1. Run `lake exe cache get && lake build`.
2. Read `Examples/OneTimePad/Basic.lean` for a compact modern proof (correctness and privacy).
3. Choose the work area by task: use `VCVio/` for oracle/probability/program-logic work, `LatticeCrypto/` for lattice schemes and reductions, and `LatticeCryptoTest/` for vectors or differential tests.
4. If probability lemmas fail unexpectedly, first check for `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`
   or `[IsUniformSpec spec]` as appropriate.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Attribution, Headers, And Docstrings

Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repo's explicit attribution policy.

- New Lean files should use the standard copyright / license / authors header and a module docstring.
- For ordinary Lean source files, use the standard prologue layout: header, blank line, `module`, public imports, blank line, module docstring.
- Docstrings must be intrinsic and descriptive. Cross-reference live sibling definitions when helpful, but do not mention removed or renamed declarations, change history, or use reactive wording such as "replaces" or "renamed from".
- Preserve existing headers on routine edits.
- Only rewrite attribution when a file is genuinely new or materially replaced.
- Do not add a separate AI-attribution line.
- For inline section breaks within a Lean file, use Mathlib-style doc-comment headers `/-! ## Title -/` (or the multi-line `/-! ## Title \n\n explanation -/` form). **Do not use ASCII banners** such as `-- ====...===` flanking a `-- § Title` line. The `/-!` form is rendered by `doc-gen4`; ASCII banners are not, and they make the file feel artificially partitioned. If a section is large enough to want a loud header, it is usually large enough to want its own `namespace` or its own file. See *Section Headers Within A File* in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Module Scopes

Active Lean libraries and tests use Lean's module system. Put declarations in a `public section`;
use `public meta section` for tactic and elaborator code. During this compatibility-first migration,
ordinary source files use `@[expose] public section` so existing downstream definitional equalities
remain available. New code may expose individual definitions instead when an opaque API boundary is
intentional and covered by public lemmas. Executable and runtime implementation modules should use
opaque `public section` when callers do not need to unfold their definitions.

- Use `public import` for dependencies that form part of the module's transitive public surface and
  `public meta import` for exported tactic/elaborator dependencies.
- Use plain `import` for implementation-only dependencies. A proof module may use `import all` to
  access an unexposed implementation from the same dependency when proving its public API.
- Do not enable `backward.privateInPublic` or `backward.proofsInPublic`; resolve visibility and
  proof-metavariable issues directly.
- Keep the dormant `Interop` library outside this policy until it is migrated separately.

## What This Project Is

VCVio is a framework for formal cryptographic proofs built around `OracleComp spec α`, the free monad on the polynomial functor induced by an oracle signature `OracleSpec ι := ι → Type`. Its universal fold `simulateQ impl : OracleComp spec α → r α` is the unique monad morphism extending any `impl : QueryImpl spec r` to the free monad. For `OracleComp`, `support` is definitionally `simulateQ` into `SetM` with queries interpreted by `Set.univ`; `evalDist` / `probOutput` / `Pr[…]` are definitionally `simulateQ` into `PMF` using the per-query distributions supplied by `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`. Uniform cardinality lemmas and the `support`/probability bridge use `[IsUniformSpec spec]`, which bundles `[spec.Fintype]`, `[spec.Inhabited]`, and uniform sampling. `ProbComp α := OracleComp unifSpec α` specializes to computations whose only oracle is uniform selection.

The repo also includes a first-class lattice cryptography library under `LatticeCrypto/`, built on top of the `VCVio` framework. That layer contains generic lattice algebra plus ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon specifications, security statements, concrete implementations, and tests; the native FFI bridges live in the separate `Extern/` library.

## Repo Map

- `VCVio/`: generic oracle-computation framework, program logic, crypto abstractions, and generic reductions.
- `ToMathlib/`: local Mathlib-facing utilities and lemmas intended to remain below the framework layer.
- `Extern/`: native FFI surface — the `@[extern]` bindings (SHA-3/SHAKE, ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Falcon) and the FFI-backed concrete instances that reach them. No proof library may import it; the backing `extern_lib`s become empty stubs when `third_party/` submodules are absent.
- `LatticeCrypto/`: lattice-specific algebra, hardness assumptions, scheme definitions, security theorems, and concrete implementations.
- `HashSig/`: hash-based signatures — SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, FIPS 205) proof-level specs and security. Peer of `LatticeCrypto/`; depends on `VCVio`/`ToMathlib` but nothing in those imports it back.
- `LatticeCryptoTest/`: ACVP vectors, executable regression tests, and cross-checks against native backends.
- `VCVioTest/`: framework smoke tests and test support modules.
- `VCVioWidgets/`: optional widget experiments and visualizations.
- `Examples/`: compact framework examples such as OneTimePad, ElGamal, Schnorr, and program-logic tactic walkthroughs.
- `Interop/`: experimental bridges to Rust verification frontends (hax, aeneas). **Strict TCB isolation**: nothing in core VCVio depends on it. See `docs/agents/interop.md`.
- `csrc/`: C FFI shims used for differential testing against native ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon code.
- `third_party/`: native backends as git submodules; when they are not checked out (fresh clones, Lake dependency checkouts), the native `extern_lib` targets build as empty stub archives.

## Module Layering

For `VCVio/`:

```
ToMathlib → Prelude → EvalDist/Defs → OracleComp core → EvalDist bridge
  → {SimSemantics, QueryTracking, Constructions, Coercions, ProbComp}
  → {ProgramLogic, CryptoFoundations, CryptoFoundations/Asymptotics} → Examples
```

New files must respect this DAG. `EvalDist/` must never import from `OracleComp/`.

For `LatticeCrypto/`, the rough dependency direction is:

```
{Ring/*, DiscreteGaussian}
  → HardnessAssumptions
  → {MLDSA, MLKEM, Falcon}
  → Concrete implementations / security wrappers
  → Extern (FFI bindings + FFI-backed instances)
  → LatticeCryptoTest
```

Scheme-specific code in `LatticeCrypto/` may depend on `VCVio/CryptoFoundations`, but not the other way around.

The native FFI surface lives in `Extern/`: it may import `VCVio`, `LatticeCrypto`,
and `ToMathlib`, but no proof library (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`,
`HashSig/`, `Examples/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `Interop/`) may import `Extern.…`. That
keeps every proof library — and any downstream Lake project requiring VCVio —
link-safe when the `third_party/` submodules are absent. Enforced by
`scripts/check-extern-isolation.sh` on every PR.

For `Interop/`, the dependency contract is one-way:

```
Interop/{Hax,Aeneas,Rust}/  →  VCVio/, ToMathlib/, (Hax.…), (Aeneas.…)
```

`Interop/**` may **never** be imported from `VCVio/`, `LatticeCrypto/`,
`LatticeCryptoTest/`, `Examples/`, `ToMathlib/`, `Extern/`, `VCVioWidgets/`,
or `VCVioTest/`. This contract is enforced by
`scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` and the
`Interop TCB Isolation` GitHub workflow on every PR.

## Critical Gotchas

1. **Probability assumptions are explicit.** `support` on `OracleComp spec` works for arbitrary specs. `evalDist` / `Pr[...]` need `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`; uniform/cardinality lemmas and `support ↔ Pr[= _] ≠ 0` need `[IsUniformSpec spec]`. Use `IsUniformSpec.ofFintypeInhabited` when you have `[spec.Fintype] [spec.Inhabited]` and intend uniform semantics.
2. **`autoImplicit = false` is set globally in `lakefile.lean`**. Do not add `set_option autoImplicit false` in individual files. Every variable must be explicitly declared.
3. **`evalDist` IS `simulateQ`** with `IsProbabilitySpec.toPMF`; under `[IsUniformSpec spec]` this is uniform. This is definitional (`rfl`).
4. **`++ₒ` is dead** — use `+` for combining oracle specs.
5. **Commented-out code is legacy** — follow only uncommented code. Use `Examples/OneTimePad/Basic.lean` as canonical reference.
6. **Preserve partial proofs** with `stop` instead of deleting large proof blocks.
7. **Do not disable linters to silence errors**. Do not use `set_option linter.* false`, `set_option weak.linter.* false`, or add repo-level `leanOptions` that turn lints off to dodge a fixable issue. Fix the root cause instead. (The one deliberate, documented exception is `weak.linter.unicodeLinter, false` in `lakefile.lean`, off so FIPS-204 math notation and diacritics in cited author names are allowed.)
8. **Interop TCB isolation is mandatory**. Core VCVio (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`, `Examples/`, `LatticeCryptoTest/`, `Extern/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `VCVioTest/`) must never `import Interop.…`, `import Hax.…`, or `import Aeneas.…`. CI fails the PR if it does. See `docs/agents/interop.md`.
9. **Extern link-safety isolation is mandatory**. Proof libraries (`VCVio/`, `ToMathlib/`, `LatticeCrypto/`, `HashSig/`, `Examples/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, `Interop/`) must never `import Extern.…`: the native backends behind it are built as empty stubs whenever the `third_party/` submodules are absent — always the case for Lake dependency checkouts — so importing `Extern` would break downstream executable links. Test libraries may import it. Enforced by `scripts/check-extern-isolation.sh` in CI.

For the full list, see `docs/agents/gotchas.md`.

## Naming Conventions

Follow Mathlib convention: `{head_symbol}_{operation}_{rhs_form}`.
Examples: `probOutput_bind_eq_tsum`, `support_pure`, `simulateQ_map`.
Structures use UpperCamelCase: `SecExp`, `SymmEncAlg`, `RelTriple`.

## Program Logic Tactics

For new program-logic proofs, import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics`.
`VCVio.ProgramLogic.Notation` keeps notation plus compatibility macros, but
`Tactics.lean` is the canonical interactive proof mode.

For the tactic reference, proof-mode entry points, and workflow details, see
[`docs/agents/program-logic.md`](docs/agents/program-logic.md). The two
`@[vcspec]` and `@[wpStep]` registries are indexed via
`Lean.Meta.Sym.Pattern` / `Lean.Meta.Sym.DiscrTree`. `Sym.*` is under active
development in core Lean; see the *Internal Architecture* and *SymM
Stability Note* sections of that doc for the churn classes to watch at each
toolchain bump and the re-entry plan for the deferred `mvcgen'`/`SymM`
rewriter bridge (when it lands, `Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` rebuilds the
bundle on demand).

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get && lake build
```

CI runs the timed build on the non-test Lean libraries:
`ToMathlib`, `VCVio`, `LatticeCrypto`, `Extern`, `HashSig`, `Examples`,
and `VCVioWidgets`. The dormant `Interop` target remains excluded.
The timing report parses per-file build times only for that same set.
Test libraries and test executables are not part of the timed build; CI only
times the smoke module separately with `lake env lean VCVioTest/Smoke.lean`.

After the build, CI runs `./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh` and then
`lake exe axiomsweep --check`: kernel-level axiom/`sorry` accounting for every
declaration in the non-test libraries, gated against the committed baseline
`scripts/axiom_baseline.json`. It fails on *new* `sorryAx` or non-standard-axiom
taint; after intentionally adding or closing a `sorry`, run
`lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline` and commit the diff. `Interop` (the
declared TCB) is excluded — its boundary is enforced by the import-isolation
gate instead.

The baseline is an allowlist for `sorryAx` debt only. Native trust
(`native_decide`, which mints per-declaration `._native.` axioms) is held to a
zero-debt rule: anything outside the explicit `grandfatheredNativeTrust` list in
`scripts/AxiomSweep.lean` fails `--check` and cannot be greened by editing the
baseline, since accepting it would widen the trusted computing base. The
`VCVioAxiomSweepTestFixtures` library carries synthetic taint for the tool's own
tests and is deliberately excluded from every aggregate.

After adding new `.lean` files: `./scripts/update-lib.sh`

Lean toolchain and Mathlib must stay in sync (both currently `v4.33.0`). Keep files
reasonably sized, but there is no hard line-count limit (the file-length linter is off).
